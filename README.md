# Time-Series-Forecasting-using-SARIMA-LSTM-Hybrid-Model
Sales analysis is important for any working industry. It helps them to keep a record and predict the sales in near future. In this project, a public data-set which includes the sales history of 4 years of a retail store is investigated to forecast the sales of furniture which is showing seasonality in its trend. To this aim, several forecasting models are applied. First, a conventional SARIMA model is applied. Then a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is applied. Then the data is decomposed into the seasonal and non-seasonal parts and a SARIMA-LSTM HYBRID model is applied to predict the future sales. The performances of the models are compared using RMSE and MAE.
